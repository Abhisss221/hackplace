# YOLOv8 Object Detection

This project utilizes the **YOLOv8** model for real-time object detection in a video. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects with different colors assigned to specific object categories like persons, vehicles, animals, etc. 

## Features
- Object detection using the YOLOv8 model.
- Bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Color-coded bounding boxes based on object class (e.g., red for persons, green for vehicles, etc.).
- Ability to process input video and save the annotated output.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 (YOLOv8 model)

### Python Libraries
You need to install the following Python libraries before running the code:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install ultralytics
